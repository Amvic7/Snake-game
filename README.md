# Snake-game
 This is a classic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle module. The player controls the snake using "W", "A", "S", "D" keys to eat food and grow the snake. The game ends when the snake hits the walls or its own tail. The score increases as the snake eats food, and the scoreboard resets upon collision.
